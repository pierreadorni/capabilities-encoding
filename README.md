# RSFM Capabilities Encoding

This repository contains the code and data used in the paper **"Towards Efficient Benchmarking of Foundation Models in Remote Sensing:
A Capabilities Encoding Approach"**.

## Abstract

> Foundation models constitute a significant advancement
in computer vision: after a single, albeit costly, training phase, they can address a wide array of tasks. In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model’s performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call “capabilities encoding.” The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research.

## Usage

You will find the scripts to reproduce the results of the paper in the `scripts` folder.

### `spaces_comparison.py`

Generates the *figure 3* of the paper.

### `val_error_experiment.py`

Generates a heatmap of the validation error of the models on the downstream tasks. The heatmap is saved in the `plots` folder. This is useful to visualize possible bad data points and weaknesses of the prediction model.

### `train.py`

Trains the latent space model. Parameters:

#### Examples
Generate the latent space shown in the paper: train on the full dataset
```bash
python scripts/train.py data/data.csv --lr 0.05 --n-iter 500 --dist l2 --dims 5 --val 0 --normalize --cv-folds 1
```

Try to predict the actual distance to best, not the relative distance to best normalized between 0 and 1:
```bash
python scripts/train.py data/data.csv --lr 0.05 --n-iter 500 --dist l2 --dims 5 --val 50 --cv-folds 50
```

Change the dimension of the latent space:
```bash
python scripts/train.py data/data.csv --lr 0.05 --n-iter 500 --dist l2 --dims 2 --val 50 --cv-folds 50 --no-umap
```
